# ProducerFold
Producer Fold is a simple, scripted tool that helps music producers sort their songs. It can be used to quickly organize songs into folders based on various criteria, such as genre, BPM, Artworks or more. This can save producers a lot of time when trying to find the right track for a specific project.
